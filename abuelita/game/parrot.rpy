    "My grandma used to have a parrot named Picasso."
    "She would put his cage outside on the balcony above the door. "
    "My grandma never opened the door before asking who was there."
    "So when someone rang the doorbell Picaso would say “who is it” and just after the person responded, the bird would keep asking questions that he had heard before. So every time somebody would ring the bell and my grandma couldn’t answer immediately I would hide close to the door and giggle at the scene."
